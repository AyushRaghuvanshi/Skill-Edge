# SKILLEDGE

SKILLEDGE is a mobile application that allows users to register as a student or educator. Students can view courses according to their interests, search courses, preview courses, add them to their cart, and purchase courses. Once the courses have been purchased, they can rate the courses, leave a review message, and watch the courses lesson by lesson. 

We have also implemented a wallet system that integrates with Razorpay. Users can add money to their wallet and use that money to purchase courses. Educators can host courses for free until they receive an average rating of at least 2.5. Once they have received this rating, they can put their courses up for sale.

The app is built on Flutter and the backend is built on Django.
